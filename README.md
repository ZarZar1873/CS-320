How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by developing well designed tests that have as much of a coverage as possible to ensure every area of the program is tested. This includes ensuring that the boarder cases are accounted for as that is where the majority of errors occure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by utalizing the requirements, user stories, and other documentation at my disposal. Following these, along with any other resources such as a project manager, scrum master, or fellow developers (depending on the development style of the company) will ensure that all the needs are met.

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software in a linear sense. I will start with the basics, like variables I know I will need or packages I know I will need to add. Next I start with a need I am to meet, if I need more variables I add them, if I need another package I add it, and if I need another function to make the need be met then I will go to that function and start the cycle over again. I will also reuse any functions I can when moving forward.
